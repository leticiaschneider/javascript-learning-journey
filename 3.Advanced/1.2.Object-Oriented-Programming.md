# Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript
OOP is a programming paradigm that models real-world entities as objects. It emphasizes organizing code around objects and their interactions rather than around functions and logic. JavaScript, though primarily known as a prototype-based language, supports many OOP concepts and allows developers to use object-oriented principles effectively.

## Key Concepts in OOP

### <ins>Class</ins>
A class is a blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. In JavaScript, classes are a syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance and were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). Classes provide a clearer and more familiar syntax for OOP.

```jsx
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
person1.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice
```

<br>

### <ins>Object</ins>
An object is an instance of a class. It contains properties and methods defined by its class. Each object can have its own values for the properties defined in the class.

```jsx
const person1 = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
};

person1.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice
```

<br>

### <ins>Inheritance</ins>
Inheritance allows one class (the child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (the parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes.

```jsx
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("The animal speaks.");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.speak(); // Outputs: The animal speaks.
dog.bark();  // Outputs: Woof!
```

<br>

### <ins>Polymorphism</ins>
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method to operate differently based on the objectâ€™s type.

```jsx
class Shape {
  draw() {
    console.log("Drawing a shape.");
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  draw() {
    console.log("Drawing a circle.");
  }
}

class Square extends Shape {
  draw() {
    console.log("Drawing a square.");
  }
}

function drawShape(shape) {
  shape.draw();
}

const circle = new Circle();
const square = new Square();

drawShape(circle); // Outputs: Drawing a circle.
drawShape(square); // Outputs: Drawing a square.
```
