# Exception Handling
Exception handling is a way to manage errors that occur while a program is running. Think of it like a safety net for your code. When something goes wrong—like trying to divide by zero or accessing a file that doesn’t exist—an "exception" is raised. Exception handling helps the program to deal with these problems smoothly without crashing.

Here's how it works:

1. **`Try` Block**: You write the code that might cause an error inside a `try` block. This is where you suspect something might go wrong.
2. **`Catch` Block**: If an error happens, the program jumps to the `catch` block, where you handle the problem. For example, you might show an error message or try to fix the issue.
3. **`Finally` Block**: This part is optional but useful. It runs after the `try` and `catch` blocks, no matter what. It’s often used for clean-up tasks, like closing files or releasing resources.

```jsx
try {
    // Code that may throw an error
    let result = riskyFunction(); // Assume this function might throw an error
} catch (error) {
    // Code to handle the error
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
} finally {
    // Code that always runs
    console.log("This code runs regardless of whether an error occurred.");
}
```

### The `throw` Statement
The `throw` statement is used to create and throw an exception manually. This allows you to signal that something went wrong in your code. You can throw built-in error objects or create your own custom error objects.

```jsx
// Throwing a generic Error object
throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
```
_In this example, a new Error object is created with a message "Something went wrong!" and thrown._

#### <ins>Custom Error Objects</ins>
You can also create your own custom error objects by extending the built-in `Error` class. This can be useful if you want to define specific types of errors with additional properties.
```jsx
class CustomError extends Error {
    constructor(message, errorCode) {
        super(message); // Pass message to the base Error class
        this.name = "CustomError"; // Set the error name
        this.errorCode = errorCode; // Add a custom property
    }
}

throw new CustomError("Custom error occurred", 404);
```
<br>

#### <ins>Utilizing Error Objects</ins>
When a runtime error occurs, a new `Error` object is created and thrown. With this `Error` object, we can determine the type of the Error and handle it according to its type.

**Types of Errors:**

Besides error constructors, Javascript also has other core Error constructors.

- **`AggregateError`**: Represents multiple errors wrapped in a single error object. This is useful when you need to handle a group of errors together.
  ```jsx
  const errors = [new TypeError("Type error"), new RangeError("Range error")];
  throw new AggregateError(errors, "Multiple errors occurred");
  ```

- **`EvalError`**: Indicates errors related to the `eval()` function. This is a less common error, as most modern JavaScript environments avoid using `eval()`.
  ```jsx
  throw new EvalError("Error with eval function");
  ```
  
- **`InternalError`**: Represents errors that are not part of the standard specification but are used internally by JavaScript engines. These errors are rarely encountered by regular code.
  ```jsx
  throw new InternalError("Internal error occurred");
  ```

- **`RangeError`**: Occurs when a value is not within the allowed range. Common examples include passing an invalid range for an array or exceeding the maximum stack size.
  ```jsx
  throw new RangeError("Number is out of range");
  ```

- **`ReferenceError`**: Happens when referencing a variable or function that does not exist. This often occurs when there is a typo or a variable is used before it is declared.
  ```jsx
  throw new ReferenceError("Variable is not defined");
  ```

- **`SyntaxError`**: Thrown when there is a syntax error in the code, such as a missing parenthesis or an incorrect structure in a statement.
  ```jsx
  throw new SyntaxError("Invalid syntax");
  ```
