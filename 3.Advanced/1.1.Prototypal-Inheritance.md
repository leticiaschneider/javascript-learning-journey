# Prototypal Inheritance

![Prototypal Inheritance](https://content.antistatique.net/app/uploads/2023/10/6346760642363392.png)

In JavaScript, every object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]`, which you can access via the `__proto__` property. This prototype property links an object to another object from which it inherits properties and methods. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks at the object itself. If it doesn't find the property or method, it looks up the prototype chain using the `__proto__` property until it finds it or reaches the end of the chain.

```jsx
const animal = {
  speak() {
    console.log("The animal speaks.");
  }
};

const dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.bark = function() {
  console.log("Woof!");
};

dog.speak(); // Outputs: The animal speaks.
dog.bark();  // Outputs: Woof!
```

- _`dog` is created using `Object.create(animal)`. This means `dog's [[Prototype]]` is set to `animal`._
- _When you call `dog.speak()`, JavaScript first looks for `speak` on the `dog` object. It doesn't find it there, so it uses `dog.__proto__` (which is animal) to find `speak`._

### <ins>Prototype Chain and `Object.prototype`</ins>

At the top of the prototype chain is `Object.prototype`. This is the default prototype for all objects created in JavaScript, and it contains common methods like `toString()`, `hasOwnProperty()`, and `valueOf()`. If a property or method is not found on an object, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain to `Object.prototype`.
```jsx
// Create a new object
const car = {
  brand: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Corolla'
};

// Use a method inherited from Object.prototype
console.log(car.toString()); // Outputs: [object Object]

// Check if the object has a specific property
console.log(car.hasOwnProperty('brand')); // Outputs: true
```

<br>

### <ins>Modifying Prototypes</ins>
You can modify prototypes to add or change properties and methods. However, modifying prototypes can have unintended consequences, especially if the changes affect all objects inheriting from that prototype.
```jsx
Object.prototype.describe = function() {
  console.log("This is an object.");
};

const obj = {};
obj.describe(); // Outputs: This is an object.
```
- _In this example, adding a `describe` method to `Object.prototype` makes it available to all objects. This can be useful but should be done with caution to avoid conflicts with existing properties or methods._
