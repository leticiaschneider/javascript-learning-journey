# Design Patterns
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. In JavaScript, design patterns help in creating more structured and maintainable code. Here are some of the most common design patterns in JavaScript:

#### <ins>Creational Patterns</ins>
 - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
 - **Factory**: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 - **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
 - **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
 - **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying existing ones (cloning), instead of creating from scratch.

#### <ins>Structural Patterns</ins>
- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
- **Decorator**: Allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.

#### <ins>Behavioral Patterns</ins>
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it on to the next handler in the chain.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

#### <ins>Concurrency Patterns (less common in JS)</ins>
- **Thread Pool**: Manages a pool of worker threads to optimize the use of resources by reusing threads for different tasks rather than creating new ones for each task.

#### <ins>Architectural Patterns</ins>
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separates an application into three main logical components: Model, View, and Controller, each with a specific responsibility.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Similar to MVC but introduces a ViewModel to handle the state and behavior of the view.
- **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)**: Similar to MVC but the Presenter handles the logic and updates the View directly.
- **MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator)**: Extends MVVM by adding a Coordinator to manage navigation and flow between different parts of the application, enhancing separation of concerns.
- **VIPER (View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router)**: A modular architecture that separates an application into five components: View (UI), Interactor (business logic), Presenter (mediator), Entity (data models), and Router (navigation logic).
