## Data Types

> [!NOTE]

> In computer science and computer programming, a data type or simply type is an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

There are a few different types of data we can store in variables.

### Numbers
A number data type can be an integer, a floating point value, an exponential value, a `NaN` (Not-a-Number) or a `Infinity`.

- A `NaN` results when we try to perform an operation on a number with a non-numeric value
- If a number is divided by 0, the resulting value is `Infinity`.
- JavaScript has a `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()` function to convert strings to numbers.

> [!NOTE]
> `Infinity` in JavaScript is a special number with an interesting property: it's bigger than any finite number.

### Null
The null in JavaScript is a data type that is represented by only one value, the ‘null’ itself. A null value means no value.
```jsx
var a = null;
console.log(a);   // This returns null
```

### Boolean
The boolean data type has only two values, true and false. It is mostly used to check a logical condition.

- Booleans are returned as-is.
- undefined turns into `false`.
- null turns into `false`.
- 0, -0, and `NaN` turn into `false`; other numbers turn into `true`.
- 0n turns into `false`; other BigInts turn into `true`.
- Symbols turn into `true`.
- All objects become `true`.

### Symbol
The symbol data type defines a property of an object which is private to the object. It refers to the ‘key’ of the key-value pair of an object.

```jsx
var object1 = {
   name: ‘Shalini’,
   age: 25,
   city: ‘Mumbai’
}
var occupation = Symbol(‘engineer’);
```

The function Symbol() is used to create a new symbol. Here we have created a symbol ‘occupation’ with the value ‘engineer’ for the above object ‘object1’.
