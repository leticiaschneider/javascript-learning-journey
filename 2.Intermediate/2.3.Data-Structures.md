# Data Structures in JavaScript
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, managing, and storing data in a way that allows for efficient access and modification. In JavaScript, data structures can be broadly categorized into two types: **primitive** (built-in) and **non-primitive** (custom) data structures.

<br>

#### <ins>Primitive Data Structures</ins>
Primitive data structures are the basic building blocks provided by the language itself. These include:

- **Arrays**: Ordered collections of elements that can be accessed by an index. Arrays are versatile and widely used in JavaScript for storing lists of data.
- **Objects**: Collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier associated with a value. Objects are fundamental to JavaScript and are used to model real-world entities.

hese built-in data structures are ready to use out of the box, making them easy to implement and highly accessible for developers.

<br>

#### <ins>Non-Primitive Data Structures</ins>
Non-primitive data structures, on the other hand, are not provided by default in JavaScript. They must be implemented by developers if they need to use them. These include more complex structures such as:

- **Stacks**: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure where the most recently added element is the first to be removed.
- **Queues**: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure where the first added element is the first to be removed.
- **Linked** Lists: A collection of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structures where each node has a value and pointers to child nodes, with a single node designated as the root.
- **Graphs**: Collections of nodes connected by edges, used to represent networks and relationships.
- **Heaps**: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property, often used in priority queues.

These data structures are essential for solving more complex problems and optimizing performance in specific scenarios. They are not directly available in JavaScript and must be implemented through custom code.

### Keyed Collections

#### <ins>Arrays</ins>
Arrays are ordered collections of values. They can hold items of any type, including other arrays and objects.

**Key Operations:**
- Creation: `let arr = [1, 2, 3];`
- Accessing Elements: `arr[0]; // 1`
- Adding Elements: `arr.push(4);`
- Removing Elements: `arr.pop();`
- Iterating: `arr.forEach(item => console.log(item));`
- Methods: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `find()`, etc.

<br>

#### <ins>Objects</ins>
Objects are collections of key-value pairs where the keys are strings (or Symbols) and the values can be any type.

**Key Operations:**
- Creation: **let obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };**
- Accessing Values: **obj.name; // "Alice"**
- Modifying Values: **obj.age = 26;**
- Adding Properties: **obj.city = "New York";**
- Methods: **Object.keys()**, **Object.values()**, **Object.entries()**

<br>

#### <ins>Sets</ins>
Sets are collections of unique values. They are useful for ensuring that all items in the collection are distinct.

**Key Operations:**
- Creation: `let set = new Set([1, 2, 3]);`
- Adding Elements: `set.add(4);`
- Removing Elements: `set.delete(2);`
- Checking Presence: `set.has(3);`
- Iterating: `set.forEach(value => console.log(value));`
- Methods: `size`, `clear()`, `entries()`

<br>

#### <ins>Maps</ins>
Maps are collections of key-value pairs where the keys can be any data type (not just strings). They maintain the insertion order of keys.

**Key Operations:**
- Creation: `let map = new Map([[1, 'one'], [2, 'two']]);`
- Accessing Values: `map.get(1); // 'one'`
- Adding Entries: `map.set(3, 'three');`
- Removing Entries: `map.delete(2);`
- Checking Presence: `map.has(1);`
- Iterating: `map.forEach((value, key) => console.log(key, value));`
- Methods: `size`, `clear()`, `entries()`

<br>

#### <ins>WeakSets</ins>
WeakSets are collections of objects where values are held weakly. This means that objects in a WeakSet can be garbage-collected if there are no other references to them.

**Key Operations:**
- Creation: `let weakSet = new WeakSet();`
- Adding Objects: `weakSet.add(obj);`
- Checking Presence: `weakSet.has(obj);`
- Methods: `add()`, `has()`

<br>

#### <ins>WeakMaps</ins>
WeakMaps are collections of key-value pairs where keys are objects and are held weakly. They allow for garbage collection of keys when there are no other references to them.

**Key Operations:**
- Creation: `let weakMap = new WeakMap();`
- Setting Entries: `weakMap.set(keyObj, value);`
- Getting Values: `weakMap.get(keyObj);`
- Checking Presence: `weakMap.has(keyObj);`
- Methods: `set()`, `get()`, `has()`

### Indexed Collections
Indexed collections are data structures that store elements in a sequential order, allowing easy access to each element using an index. In JavaScript, the most common indexed collections are arrays and typed arrays.

#### <ins>Arrays</ins>
Arrays are versatile and widely used data structures in JavaScript. They allow you to store multiple values in a single variable, with each value accessible by its index. JavaScript arrays are dynamic, meaning they can grow or shrink as needed, and they can hold different data types, such as numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

#### <ins>Typed Arrays</ins>
Typed arrays are a special kind of array that provides a way to work with binary data directly. They are fixed in length and are designed to hold a specific type of data, such as integers or floating-point numbers. Typed arrays are particularly useful when dealing with raw binary data, such as when working with WebGL, file handling, or network protocols.

#### <ins>Importance of Indexed Collections in Structured Data</ins>
Indexed collections like arrays and typed arrays are essential for managing structured data in JavaScript. They provide a way to organize and manipulate data efficiently, which is crucial in scenarios like processing large datasets, handling user input, or managing resources in applications.

By leveraging these data structures, developers can ensure that their applications are both performant and scalable, capable of handling complex data manipulation tasks with ease. Whether dealing with general-purpose data in arrays or more specialized binary data in typed arrays, understanding and utilizing these indexed collections is a key aspect of effective web development.

## Structured data
Structured data is a standardized format used to annotate content on web pages, enabling search engines and other platforms to understand and interpret the information more effectively. 

### <ins>Working with JSON in JavaScript</ins>
In JavaScript, working with JSON involves converting between JSON strings and JavaScript objects. This conversion is essential when dealing with data received from or sent to a server, as JSON is the standard format for data interchange in web APIs.

- Converting JavaScript Objects to JSON (`JSON.stringify`)
    
    When you need to send data from your JavaScript application to a server or store it in a format that can be easily shared, you use `JSON.stringify()`. This method takes a JavaScript object and converts it into a JSON string:

    ```jsx
    const article = {
      title: "Introduction to JSON",
      author: "Jane Doe",
      published: true,
      tags: ["JSON", "JavaScript", "Data"]
    };
    
    const jsonString = JSON.stringify(article);
    console.log(jsonString);
    ```

    The output will be a JSON string:
    ```jsx
    {"title":"Introduction to JSON","author":"Jane Doe","published":true,"tags":["JSON","JavaScript","Data"]}
    ```
<br>

- Converting JSON to JavaScript Objects (`JSON.parse`)
    
    When you receive JSON data from a server or read it from a file, you'll need to convert it back into a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()`. This allows you to manipulate the data directly in your JavaScript code:

    ```jsx
    const jsonString = '{"title":"Introduction to JSON","author":"Jane Doe","published":true,"tags":["JSON","JavaScript","Data"]}';

    const articleObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
    console.log(articleObject.title); // Outputs: Introduction to JSON
    ```
