# Strict Mode
Strict mode is a feature in JavaScript that helps you write cleaner and more reliable code by enforcing stricter parsing and error handling. It was introduced in ECMAScript 5 (ES5) and can be applied to entire scripts or individual functions.

### How to Enable Strict Mode
You enable strict mode by adding use strict; at the beginning of a script or function. This directive tells the JavaScript engine to execute the code in strict mode.
```jsx
"use strict";

function strictFunction() {
  // Code here is in strict mode
}

strictFunction();
```

You can also enable strict mode for a specific function:

```jsx
function nonStrictFunction() {
  // Code here is not in strict mode
}

function strictFunction() {
  "use strict";
  // Code here is in strict mode
}

nonStrictFunction();
strictFunction();
```

### Benefits of Using Strict Mode
Using strict mode can provide several benefits:

- **Improved Code Quality:** Strict mode helps to catch potential errors early in the development process, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.
- **Enhanced Security:** Strict mode can help to prevent certain security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Better Performance:** Strict mode can sometimes result in slightly better performance due to optimizations that can be performed by the JavaScript engine.
- **Increased Compatibility:** Strict mode is supported by modern browsers and JavaScript engines, making your code more compatible with future versions of the language.
