# Control Structures
Control structures are fundamental in programming, allowing you to control the flow of your program based on different conditions or repeating tasks.

## **Conditionals**

&nbsp; &nbsp; Conditionals are used to make decisions in your code based on whether certain conditions are true or false.

- **`if` Statement:** The if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
  ```jsx
  let age = 18;
  if (age >= 18) {
      console.log("You are an adult.");
  }
  // Output: "You are an adult."
  ```

  <br>
- **`else` Statement:** The else statement executes a block of code if the if condition is false.
  ```jsx
  let age = 16;
  if (age >= 18) {
      console.log("You are an adult.");
  } else {
      console.log("You are not an adult.");
  }
  // Output: "You are not an adult."
  ```
  <br>

- **`else if` Statement:** The else if statement is used to specify a new condition if the first if condition is false. You can have multiple else if statements to check for different conditions.
  ```jsx
  let score = 85;
  if (score >= 90) {
      console.log("Grade: A");
  } elseif (score >= 80) {
      console.log("Grade: B");
  } else {
      console.log("Grade: C");
  }
  // Output: "Grade: B"
  ```
  <br>

- **`switch` Statement:** The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It's an alternative to multiple else if statements.
  ```jsx
  let fruit = "apple";
  switch (fruit) {
      case"banana":
          console.log("I am a banana");
          break;
      case"apple":
          console.log("I am an apple");
          break;
      default:
          console.log("I am a fruit");
  }
  // Output: "I am an apple"
  ```
  <br>


## **Loops**

&nbsp; &nbsp; Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

- **`for` Loop:** The for loop is the most commonly used loop that repeats a block of code a specific number of times.
  ```jsx
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      console.log(i);
  }
  // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  ```
  - Initialization: `let i = 0` sets up a counter variable.
  - Condition: `i < 5` checks if the loop should continue running.
  - Iteration: `i++` increases the counter by 1 after each loop.
  
  <br>

- **`for...of` Loop:** The `for...of` statement iterates over the values of an iterable object, such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more. It is particularly useful when you need to access the actual values in an iterable rather than their indexes.

  ```jsx
  let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

    for (let fruit of fruits) {
        console.log(fruit);
    }
    // Output: "apple", "banana", "cherry"
  ```
  
  <br>

- **`for...in` Loop:** The `for...in` statement iterates over the enumerable properties of an object (or the indexes of an array). Itâ€™s useful when you want to loop through the keys of an object or the index values of an array.

  ```jsx
    let person = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30,
        city: "New York"
    };

    for (let key in person) {
        console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
    }
    // Output:
    // "name: John"
    // "age: 30"
    // "city: New York"
  ```
  
  <br>

- **`while` Loop:** The while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
  ```jsx
  let i = 0;
  while (i < 5) {
      console.log(i);
      i++;
  }
  // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  ```
  <br>

- **`do...while` Loop:** The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code will run at least once, because the condition is checked after the code runs.
  ```jsx
  let i = 0;
  do {
      console.log(i);
      i++;
  } while (i < 5);
  // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  ```
  <br>


### `break` and `continue` Statements
These statements are control flow tools that let you manage how loops and switch statements execute.

1. **`break` Statement** The break statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement immediately, regardless of the iteration or condition. When a break is encountered, the program stops executing the loop and moves on to the code that follows the loop or switch statement.
    ```jsx
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i === 5) {
            break; // Exits the loop when i is 5
        }
        console.log(i);
    }
    // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    ```
<br>

2. **`continue` Statement** The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It doesn't stop the entire loop, just the current pass through the loop.
    ```jsx
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i === 5) {
            continue; // Skips the current iteration when i is 5
        }
        console.log(i);
    }
    // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
    ```
