# Events
Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them.

## Common Types of Events:
1. Click Event: This happens when a user clicks on an element, like a button.
    ```jsx
    let button = document.querySelector('button');
    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
        alert('Button was clicked!');
    });
    ```
2. Keydown Event: This occurs when a user presses a key on the keyboard.
    ```jsx
    document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
        console.log('Key pressed: ' + event.key);
    });
    ```
3. Mouseover Event: This happens when a user moves their mouse over an element.
    ```jsx
    let box = document.querySelector('.box');
    box.addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
        box.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
    });
    ```
4. Load Event: This occurs when the web page or a certain image or script finishes loading.
    ```jsx
        window.addEventListener('load', function() {
        alert('Page has fully loaded!');
    });
    ```

## Event flow
Event flow refers to the order in which events are received and handled in the Document Object Model (DOM) when an event is triggered.
Understanding event flow is important for controlling how events interact with different elements on a webpage.

### Types of Event Flow:

#### <ins>Event Bubbling</ins>
In event bubbling, when an event is triggered, it begins at the element where it occurred and then moves up through the DOM hierarchy to the topmost elements. 

When you click the button, the click event occurs in the following order:

1. button
2. div with the id container
3. body
4. html
5. document

The event is handled by each of these elements as it bubbles up. Modern browsers even allow events to bubble up to the window object.

#### <ins>Event Capturing</ins>
Event capturing is the opposite of bubbling. In this model, the event starts at the topmost element in the DOM and then moves down to the target element.

When you click the button, the click event occurs in the following order:

1. document
2. html
3. body
4. div with the id container
5. button

This allows higher-level elements to capture the event before it reaches the more specific target.

#### <ins>DOM Level 2 Event Flow</ins>
The DOM Level 2 event model combines both event capturing and event bubbling, specifying three phases for how events are processed:

1. **Capturing Phase:** The event moves from the top of the DOM tree (like document) down to the target element.
2. **Target Phase:** The event reaches the target element where it was originally triggered.
3. **Bubbling Phase:** The event bubbles back up the DOM tree, giving each parent element a chance to handle the event.
