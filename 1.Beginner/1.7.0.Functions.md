# Function
Functions are essential building blocks in JavaScript, allowing you to encapsulate code into reusable pieces. They help organize code, perform tasks, and return values.

## Defining Functions

### <ins>Function Declaration</ins>
This is the most common way to define a function. It has a name and can be called anywhere in the code due to hoisting.
```jsx
function sayHello(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

sayHello("Alice"); // Output: "Hello, Alice!"
```
<br>

### <ins>Function Expression</ins>
A function expression is when a function is assigned to a variable. Unlike function declarations, these are not hoisted.
```jsx
const sayHello = function(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
};

sayHello("Bob"); // Output: "Hello, Bob!"
```
<br>

### <ins>Arrow Function</ins>
Introduced in ES6, arrow functions provide a more concise syntax. They are always anonymous and do not have their own this context.
```jsx
// Arrow Function With Parameters:
const sayHello = (name) => {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
};

sayHello("Charlie"); // Output: "Hello, Charlie!"
```
```jsx
// Arrow Function without Parameters:
const sayHello = () => {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
};

sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, world!"
```

<br>

## Function parameters
In JavaScript, function parameters are the values that you pass to a function when you call it. There are two special types of parameters that give you additional flexibility: default parameters and rest parameters.

### <ins>Default Parameters</ins>
Default parameters allow you to specify a default value for a function parameter if no value or undefined is passed. This helps prevent errors and makes your code more robust.
```jsx
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet(); // Output: "Hello, undefined!"
greet("Alice"); // Output: "Hello, Alice!"
```
<br>

You can also use a default value:
```jsx
function greet(name = "Guest") {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet(); // Output: "Hello, Guest!"
greet("Alice"); // Output: "Hello, Alice!"
```
<br>

### <ins>Rest Parameters</ins>
Rest parameters allow you to pass an indefinite number of arguments to a function as an array. This is useful when you don't know how many arguments will be passed in advance.

```jsx
function sum(...numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
console.log(sum(4, 5, 6, 7, 8)); // Output: 30
```
<br>

### <ins>`Arguments` Object:</ins>
This is an array-like object accessible inside all non-arrow functions in JavaScript. It contains the values of the arguments passed to that function, allowing you to handle functions with an unknown number of arguments.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Array-Like**: Although `arguments` behaves like an array (it has a `length` property and allows indexed access), it is not a true array. It doesn't have array methods like `.map()` or `.forEach()`.
- **Not Available in Arrow Functions**: The `Arguments` object is only available in regular functions. Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object.
- **Dynamic**: The `Arguments` object automatically reflects the values passed to the function, even if those values are changed inside the function.

```jsx
function sum() {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
        total += arguments[i];
    }
    return total;
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Output: 10
```
<br>

### **Rest Parameters vs. Arguments Object:**
In modern JavaScript, rest parameters `(...args)` are often preferred over the `Arguments` object because they provide a true array and are easier to work with.

<br>

## IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
It is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. It's a common design pattern used to create a private scope, avoiding the pollution of the global namespace.
```jsx
(function() {
    console.log("This function runs immediately!");
})();
```
```jsx
// Example with Parameters
(function(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
})("Alice");
```
<br>

Explanation:&nbsp; 
- The first set of parentheses `()` creates a function expression.
- The second set of parentheses `()` immediately invokes the function.

<br>

#### Why Use an IIFE?
- **Avoid Global Variables:** Variables inside an IIFE are not accessible from the outside, helping you avoid conflicts with other code.
- **Encapsulation:** You can create private variables and functions inside an IIFE that won't affect the rest of your code.
- **Isolation:** It's a way to isolate code, useful in larger projects or when integrating with third-party code.

<br>

## Function Stack
When a program runs, the function stack (or call stack) is a structure that manages the order in which functions are called and executed. Each time a function is invoked, a new frame is added to the stack, which includes information about the function's parameters, local variables, and the point at which the function should return. When the function finishes executing, its frame is removed from the stack.

### <ins>Recursion</ins>
Recursion is a concept where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. Each recursive call adds a new frame to the function stack, just like any other function call. The key to recursion is defining a base case, which is a condition under which the function stops calling itself, and a recursive case, which reduces the problem towards the base case. Without a proper base case, recursion can lead to infinite loops, resulting in a stack overflow.

```jsx
    function factorial(n) {
        if (n === 0) {
            return 1; // Base case
        }
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive call
    }

    console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```
   
- **Function Call**: `factorial(5)` is called, adding a frame to the stack.
- **Recursive Call**: `factorial(5`) calls `factorial(4)`, which adds another frame to the stack. This continues until factorial(0) is reached.
- **Base Case**: When `n === 0`, the function returns `1`, and the stack begins to unwind.
- **Stack Unwinding**: As each recursive call returns, the previous function call completes and is removed from the stack. Finally, `factorial(5)` returns `120`, which is the result of the entire recursive process.


**Stack Visualization:**

1. `factorial(5)` -> waiting for `factorial(4)`
2. `factorial(4)` -> waiting for `factorial(3)`
3. `factorial(3)` -> waiting for `factorial(2)`
4. `factorial(2)` -> waiting for `factorial(1)`
5. `factorial(1)` -> waiting for `factorial(0)`
6. `factorial(0)` -> returns `1`
7. Each call returns, multiplying the result, and the stack unwinds completely.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key Point: Recursion relies heavily on the function stack, and without a base case, it could lead to a stack overflow due to infinite recursive calls.

### <ins>Lexical scoping</ins>
Lexical scoping (also known as static scoping) is a rule that determines how variable names are resolved in nested functions: inner functions have access to variables defined in their outer scopes. The scope of a variable is defined by its position in the source code, and not by the call stack or the function that calls it. This means that a function will remember the scope in which it was created, even if it is executed in a different context.
```jsx
    function outerFunction() {
        let outerVar = "I’m outside!";

        function innerFunction() {
            let innerVar = "I’m inside!";
            console.log(outerVar); // Accesses outerVar from the outer scope
        }

        innerFunction();
    }

    outerFunction();
```
   
- **Outer Scope**: `outerFunction()` has access to its own variable `outerVar`.
- **Inner Scope**: `innerFunction()` is defined within `outerFunction()`, so it has access to both `outerVar` and `innerVar`.
- **Lexical Scoping**: When `innerFunction()` tries to access `outerVar`, JavaScript looks for `outerVar` in the current scope. If not found, it looks in the outer scope where `outerFunction()` is defined. Since `outerVar` exists there, it is accessible.


**Stack Interaction:**

- When `outerFunction()` is called, it is added to the stack.
- Within `outerFunction()`, `innerFunction()` is called and added to the stack.
- After `innerFunction()` completes, it is removed from the stack, and control returns to outerFunction(), which then completes and is also removed from the stack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key Point: Lexical scoping ensures that inner functions have access to variables in their outer function's scope, based on where the function is written, not where it is invoked.
