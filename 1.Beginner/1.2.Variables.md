## Variables

### Variable Declarations
In JavaScript, before we can use a variable, we need to declare it. This is done by using one of the keywords: *var*, *let*, or *const*.

Example: 
```jsx
let x = "John Doe";
let x = 0;
// SyntaxError: 'x' has already been declared
```

### Naming Rules
- **Allowed Characters:** Use letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).
- **Starting Character:** Must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. Cannot start with a digit.
- **Case Sensitivity:** Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are different.
- **No Reserved Words:** Cannot use JavaScript reserved words (e.g., if, let, const).
- **No Spaces**: Variable names cannot contain spaces. Use camelCase, underscores, or dollar signs to separate words.
- **Meaningful Names:** Choose descriptive names for clarity (e.g., totalPrice instead of x).

### Scopes
- **Global Scope:** Variables declared outside any function have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
    
    ```jsx
    var globalVar = "I am global";
    console.log(globalVar); // Outputs: I am global
    ```
    
- **Function Scope:** Variables declared within a function using `var` are function-scoped and can only be accessed within that function.
    
    ```jsx
    function myFunction() {
        var functionVar = "I am in a function";
        console.log(functionVar);
    }
    myFunction(); // Outputs: I am in a function
    // console.log(functionVar); // Error: functionVar is not defined
    ```
    
- **Block Scope:** Variables declared with `let` or `const` within a block (e.g., within curly braces `{}`) have block scope and can only be accessed within that block.

    ```jsx
    if (true) {
    let blockVar = "I am in a block";
    const blockConst = "I am also in a block";
    console.log(blockVar); // Outputs: I am in a block
    console.log(blockConst); // Outputs: I am also in a block
    }
    // console.log(blockVar); // Error: blockVar is not defined
    // console.log(blockConst); // Error: blockConst is not defined
    ```

### Hoisting
Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase, before the code is actually executed. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code.

- **Variable Hoisting:** <br>
  Variables declared using var are hoisted to the top of their function scope, but only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization. This means that the variable is declared, but it’s set to undefined until the line of code where you actually assign it a value.
   ```jsx
    console.log(x); // Output: undefined
   var x = 5;
   console.log(x); // Output: 5
    ```
<br>

- **Function Hoisting:** <br>
   Function declarations are hoisted entirely, meaning both the function's name and its definition are moved to the top of their scope.
   ```jsx
   console.log(foo()); // Output: "Hello"
   function foo() {
       return "Hello";
   }
    ```
<br>

- **`let` and `const` Hoisting:** <br>
   Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. They remain in a **temporal dead zone (TDZ)** from the start of the block until they are assigned a value. This is why you’ll get a `ReferenceError` if you try to access them before their declaration.
  ```jsx
   console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
   let y = 10;
    ```
<br>

> [!NOTE]
> the TDZ refers to the time between entering the scope (like a block of code) and the point where the variable is initialized. When a    variable is in the TDZ, it cannot be accessed, even though it has been hoisted. The TDZ ensures that variables are initialized in the correct order and prevents unexpected behavior.
