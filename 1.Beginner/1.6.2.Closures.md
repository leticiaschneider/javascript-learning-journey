# Closure
A closure is a function that remembers the environment (scope) in which it was created, even after that environment has gone out of scope. In simpler terms, a closure gives you access to the outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function, allowing the inner function to continue to access the outer function's variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

<br>

## How Closures Work
When a function is declared, it captures the variables in its surrounding scope (at the time of declaration) into a "closure". This means that even after the function is returned and executed elsewhere, it still has access to those captured variables.
```jsx
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I am outside!";

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Accesses the outerVariable from the outer function
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction(); // Outputs: "I am outside!"
```

In this example:

- `outerFunction` creates a variable `outerVariable` and an `innerFunction` that uses it.
- Even though `outerFunction` finishes execution after returning `innerFunction`, the returned `innerFunction` still has access to `outerVariable` because of the closure.

## Use Cases of Closures

- **Data Encapsulation**: Closures allow you to create private variables or functions that can't be accessed from outside.

    ```jsx
    function Counter() {
        let count = 0;
    
        return {
            increment: function() {
                count++;
                return count;
            },
            decrement: function() {
                count--;
                return count;
            }
        };
    }
    
    const counter = Counter();
    console.log(counter.increment()); // 1
    console.log(counter.increment()); // 2
    console.log(counter.decrement()); // 1
    ```

<br>

- **Function Factories**: Closures can be used to create functions that are customized with specific data.

    ```jsx
    function greeting(name) {
        return function(message) {
            console.log(`${message}, ${name}!`);
        };
    }
    
    const greetJohn = greeting("John");
    greetJohn("Hello"); // "Hello, John!"
    greetJohn("Goodbye"); // "Goodbye, John!"
    ```

<br>

- **Maintaining State in Asynchronous Code**: Closures are often used in callbacks or asynchronous operations to maintain access to variables that might otherwise go out of scope.

    ```jsx
    function setupTimeouts() {
        for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            setTimeout(function() {
                console.log(i);
            }, i * 1000);
        }
    }
    
    setupTimeouts(); // Outputs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (each after 1 second)
    ```

<br>

#### <ins>Memory Leaks</ins>
Closures can inadvertently cause memory leaks if they hold references to large objects or DOM elements that are no longer needed.

```jsx
function createHeavyClosure() {
    const largeObject = new Array(1000000).fill("Some data");
    return function() {
        console.log("Closure still holds large object");
    };
}

const closure = createHeavyClosure();
// If `closure` is kept around, the large object stays in memory
```
