# Function
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

- The name of the function.
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { /* â€¦ */ }.

    ```jsx
    function square(number) { 
        return number * number;
    }
    ```
